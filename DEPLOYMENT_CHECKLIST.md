## Deployment Steps
1. Build APK with unique versionCode/versionName
2. Test on target device (Pixel 7, API 34+)
3. Verify backup/export/import before update/uninstall
4. Push code and documentation to private GitHub repo
5. Use `adb install -r` or file manager to update APK (do not uninstall)
6. Restore data/settings from backup if needed

## Documentation
- See README.md for build/run instructions
- All modules and features documented in code comments
- User guide: onboarding, settings, backup/restore, chatbot automation
- Security/privacy: all sensitive data encrypted, no unnecessary permissions

## Notes
- For private use only; not Play Store/commercial release
- All data remains local unless user syncs/export/imports
- Update APK by replacing, not uninstalling, to preserve data
- For major changes, use backup/restore
